                <p>Closures are confusing because they are an “invisible” concept.</p>
                <p>When you use an object, a variable, or a function, you do this intentionally. You think: “I’m gonna need a variable here,” and add it to your code.</p>
                <p>Closures are different. By the time most people approach closures, they have already used them unknowingly many times — and it is likely that this is true for yourself, too. So learning closures is less about understanding a new concept and more about recognizing something you have already been doing for a while. </p>
